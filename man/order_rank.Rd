\title{Order and Rank Interval-Censored Data}
\usage{
order_rank(delta, gamma, U, V, Z)
}
\arguments{
\item{delta}{Numeric (0/1). Event indicator for left endpoint \code{U}.}

\item{gamma}{Numeric (0/1). Event indicator for right endpoint \code{V}.}

\item{U}{Numeric vector of left endpoints of censoring intervals (may contain \code{NA}).}

\item{V}{Numeric vector of right endpoints of censoring intervals (may contain \code{NA}).}

\item{Z}{A matrix (or data frame) of covariates, with one row per subject.}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
\describe{
  \item{\code{t}}{A condensed, ordered set of exam times.}
  \item{\code{index}}{A matrix of dimension \code{n x 2}, giving the ranks (indices)
       for \code{U} and \code{V} after ordering.}
  \item{\code{data}}{A matrix (or data frame) containing the updated
       \code{delta}, \code{gamma}, \code{U}, \code{V}, and \code{Z} values.}
}
}
\description{
Processes interval-censored data (and corresponding indicators) to produce
an ordered set of exam times and flags indicating censoring status. It also
adjusts certain \code{delta} and \code{gamma} values based on constraints
so that the first observation is always an event time, and the last
observation is always right-censored.
}
\details{
This function ensures that the earliest recorded time in \code{t} corresponds
to a left endpoint that is truly an event, while the latest recorded time
is right-censored. It also removes observations that are no longer valid
after these adjustments. The vector \code{flag} is used internally to mark
observation types (1 = event, 2 = left-censored, 3 = both, 4 = right-censored).
