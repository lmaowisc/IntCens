\title{Compute Convex Minorant}
\usage{
CM(G, Q)
}
\arguments{
\item{G}{Numeric vector of \eqn{x}-coordinates (must be the same length as \code{Q}).}

\item{Q}{Numeric vector of \eqn{y}-coordinates (must be the same length as \code{G}).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector \code{y} of length \code{length(G)}, giving the
  slopes or values associated with the convex minorant.
}
\description{
Computes a piecewise-linear convex minorant of two numeric vectors \code{G}
and \code{Q} by iteratively identifying minimum slopes and assigning them to
the output vector \code{y}. This method is sometimes used in isotonic or
shape-constrained regression contexts.
}
\details{
Internally, the function calculates slopes for segments between points
in \code{G} and picks the minimum slope iteratively, ensuring the resulting
piecewise-linear function is convex.
